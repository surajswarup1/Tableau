I have worked on diverse personal projects using Tableau that have showcased my data visualization skills 
across various domains. One notable project involved creating an interactive dashboard on Major League Baseball 
pitching data for the Houston Astros. The dashboard analyzes advanced pitching analytics over time such as spin 
rate, whiff percentage, and others, and can be filtered by pitch type and by player. I have also worked on a dashboard 
to analyze College Data for American colleges in 2022. The dashboard looks at information about college ranking, graduate 
median salary, and more, and can be filtered by state, college, and college type (public or private school). Another 
compelling project focused on Spotify data, where I designed an interactive dashboard to analyze song popularity, song 
duration, and a few other metrics over the 2010s decade. Each project showcases my ability to transform raw data into 
actionable insights to allow for informed decision making and can be viewed using the links above.
